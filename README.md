# Figure-replication

For our Differential equations and Numerical Methods project we are analysing
and replicating the models for the progress of virus cells and CD4+ cells in 
as time progresses. These files contain the code that replicate the figures seen the article.
One for the model titled "Target Cell limitation model" and the other "Activated T-cells model"
